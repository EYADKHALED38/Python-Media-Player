Python Media Player is a simple audio player
 written in Python and Tkinter GUI library.
 The project was created for practice and fun 
purposes, and it can be used by anyone who wants
 to hone their Python skills. The player displays
 a list of files in a selected directory and allows
 the user to play, pause, and stop the selected audio file.
 Additionally, the volume can be adjusted and the
 user can select a different audio file to play.
 The player's interface is clean and easy to use,
 making it a great starting point for anyone interested
 in creating their own media player
 or exploring the Tkinter GUI library.
